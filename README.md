## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

What I learned that it is still a long way for me to become better at javascript as I continue to fiddle with the script and not knowing full well for the loops, functions, and eventlistener. I had given up trying to add animation to it because of the toggle being used and if I could have known better how to use loops/iteration or whatever the term is called, then maybe the animation could have been added.

### Continued development

I'll continue to try and be better at using javascript to manipulate that interactions between the user and the page. All I know is how to do the basics of simple things that will happen to the website.
